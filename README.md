# RAG API

[![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/KulakovVladislav/rag-api/ci.yml?branch=main&label=CI)](https://github.com/KulakovVladislav/rag-api/actions)

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation API built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL + pgvector**, and **local
sentence-transformers** embeddings. Upload documents, search them semantically — no OpenAI key required.

Document ingestion is **asynchronous**: `POST /api/documents` returns immediately while chunking and embedding run
in the background, so a 50-page document no longer ties up a Gunicorn worker for 10+ seconds.

## Overview

RAG API implements the core pipeline of a document question-answering system:

- Documents are accepted instantly, then chunked and embedded **in the background**
- Document status (`processing` / `completed` / `failed`) tracks ingestion progress
- Duplicate content is rejected at ingestion time via a SHA-256 content hash — no wasted embedding work
- Semantic search finds the most relevant chunks via cosine similarity, and only ever searches `completed` documents
- Search results are cached in Redis and automatically invalidated as soon as new content finishes processing
- Every request is tagged with a request ID and timed, for request-level tracing in the logs
- Everything runs locally — embeddings are generated with `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)

### RAG Pipeline

```
POST /api/documents
  → insert document, status="processing"
  → return 202 immediately            — client is never blocked on embedding
  → [background] chunk_text()         — splits content into overlapping chunks
  → [background] get_embeddings()     — encodes chunks via sentence-transformers
  → [background] store chunks         — saves to PostgreSQL with vector(384) column
  → [background] status="completed" (or "failed" on exception)

GET /api/search?q=...
  → encode query         — converts query to vector
  → cosine search        — pgvector <=> operator, joined and filtered on status="completed"
  → return top-k chunks  — ranked by similarity score
```

---

## Async Document Processing

`POST /api/documents` no longer does chunking and embedding inline. It creates the document row with
`status="processing"`, schedules the work via FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`, and returns `202 Accepted` right away.

```
POST /api/documents  →  202 {"id": 7, "title": "...", "status": "processing", "chunk_count": 0}

  ... background task runs (chunk → embed → save chunks) ...

GET /api/documents/7  →  200 {"id": 7, ..., "status": "completed", "chunk_count": 4}
```

**Document lifecycle (finite state machine)**

```
processing ──success──▶ completed
    │
    └────failure────▶ failed
```

A document never silently disappears between states — any exception during background processing is caught,
logged with `request_id`, and the document is explicitly marked `failed` rather than being left stuck in
`processing` forever.

**Why a background task instead of Celery?** `BackgroundTasks` runs in the same process and event loop as the
API, after the response has already been sent. It's the minimal version of "don't block the request on slow work."
It is **not** real parallelism for CPU-bound work (see [Engineering Decisions](#engineering-decisions) below for
the tradeoff and when this needs to graduate to Celery/RQ + a worker pool).

**Search only returns finished documents.** `GET /api/search` joins `chunks` to `documents` and filters
`status == 'completed'` in SQL, so a query can never return a chunk from a document that's still mid-ingestion or
that failed halfway through.

---

## Content Deduplication

Before scheduling any background work, `POST /api/documents` computes a SHA-256 hash of the trimmed content and
checks it against `documents.content_hash`. If a document with identical content already exists — regardless of
its current `status` — the request is rejected instead of re-chunking and re-embedding the same text.

```
POST /api/documents  (content already ingested)
  → 409 Conflict
  {
    "detail": "Document with identical content already exists",
    "existing_document_id": 7
  }
```

This makes retried/duplicated client uploads (double-submits, retried background jobs, re-imported files) free
instead of silently doubling storage and embedding cost. The check is on exact content, not fuzzy/semantic
similarity — two documents with the same meaning but different wording are treated as distinct.

---

## Search Result Caching

`GET /api/search` is backed by Redis. The cache key is an MD5 hash of the normalized query (`lowercased`,
`stripped`) plus `top_k`, so identical searches — even across different clients — hit the same cache entry.

- **Cache hit** → response served straight from Redis, `X-Cache: HIT` header, no embedding call, no DB query.
- **Cache miss** → query is embedded, pgvector search runs, result is cached with a TTL (`search_cache_ttl`,
  default `60s`), `X-Cache: MISS` header.
- **Invalidation** — every time a document finishes background processing (`status="completed"`), all
  `search:query:*` keys are flushed, so a newly-ingested document is searchable immediately rather than waiting
  out the TTL of a stale cached result set.

This trades a small amount of staleness (bounded by the TTL, and actively cleared on new content) for
avoiding repeated embedding-model inference on hot queries.

---

## Observability

Every request is wrapped by `ProfilerAndExceptionMiddleware`:

- A `request_id` is read from the incoming `X-Request-ID` header, or generated (`uuid4`) if absent, and stored in
  a `ContextVar` for the duration of the request — so it's available to any logger call downstream without
  threading it through every function signature.
- The response carries back `X-Request-ID` and `X-Response-Time` (milliseconds) headers.
- Every request is logged as a single structured line: method, path, status code, and latency, tagged with the
  `request_id`.
- Unhandled exceptions are caught at two levels — the middleware (logs the stack trace, returns a `500` with the
  `request_id`) and a global FastAPI `@app.exception_handler(Exception)` in `main.py` as a second safety net — so
  a client always gets `{"detail": "Internal Server Error", "request_id": "..."}` instead of a raw traceback,
  and the `request_id` in the response lets you grep the exact log line for that failure.

## API Reference

### `POST /api/documents`

Accepts a document and schedules chunking + embedding in the background. Returns immediately — does **not**
wait for embedding to finish.

**Request**

```json
{
  "title": "FastAPI Guide",
  "content": "FastAPI is a modern..."
}
```

**Response `202 Accepted`**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "FastAPI Guide",
  "status": "processing",
  "chunk_count": 0
}
```

**Response `409 Conflict`** — content already ingested (matched by SHA-256 hash, see
[Content Deduplication](#content-deduplication))

```json
{
  "detail": "Document with identical content already exists",
  "existing_document_id": 7
}
```

**Response `422 Unprocessable Entity`** — empty or whitespace-only `content`

---

### `GET /api/documents/{id}`

Returns the current state of a document, including ingestion status.

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "FastAPI Guide",
  "content": "FastAPI is a modern...",
  "status": "completed",
  "chunk_count": 4,
  "chunking_time_ms": 2.31,
  "embedding_time_ms": 148.92,
  "total_processing_time_ms": 151.23
}
```

`status` is one of `processing`, `completed`, `failed`. While `processing`, `chunk_count` is `0` and the
`*_time_ms` fields are `null` — they're populated once background processing finishes, giving per-document
visibility into how much of the pipeline's latency was chunking vs. embedding.

---

### `GET /api/documents`

Lists documents with pagination. Each item includes `status` and `chunk_count`.

| Parameter | Type    | Default | Description       |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `limit`   | integer | `10`    | Page size (1–100) |
| `offset`  | integer | `0`     | Pagination offset |

---

### `GET /api/search`

Semantic search over stored chunks. Only searches chunks belonging to `completed` documents. Results are cached
in Redis (see [Search Result Caching](#search-result-caching)); the response carries an `X-Cache: HIT|MISS`
header.

**Query parameters**

| Parameter | Type    | Default  | Description                 |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------------------------|
| `q`       | string  | required | Search query                |
| `top_k`   | integer | `5`      | Number of results to return |

**Response `200`**

```json
[
  {
    "chunk_id": 3,
    "document_title": "FastAPI Guide",
    "content": "FastAPI is a modern web framework...",
    "score": 0.12
  }
]
```

> Lower score = higher similarity (cosine distance).

---

### `DELETE /api/documents/{id}`

Deletes a document and its chunks (cascade). Returns `204` on success, `404` if not found.

---

## Running Tests

Tests run against an isolated PostgreSQL container with `tmpfs` — no persistent data, no side effects.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

22 tests cover:

- **Async lifecycle** — immediate `202`/`processing` response, `completed` status with correct `chunk_count` and
  populated `*_time_ms` fields once background processing finishes, a mocked-failure path landing on
  `status="failed"`, and search excluding chunks from non-`completed` documents.
- **Deduplication** — duplicate content against a `completed` document returns `409`, duplicate content against a
  still-`processing` document also returns `409`, and genuinely different content is always accepted.
- **Search caching** — repeated identical queries return a cache hit, a new query is a cache miss, different
  `top_k` values produce different cache keys, and the cache is invalidated once a document finishes processing.
- **CRUD / validation / error handling** — listing, fetching, deleting documents (incl. `404`s), empty/whitespace
  content rejection (`422`), score ordering, and the global exception handler's response shape.

See `.env.example` for all required variables. The most relevant ones beyond standard Postgres/app settings:

| Variable                             | Used by                              | Default                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `REDIS_URL`                          | `app/config.py` → `redis_url`        | `redis://redis:6379/0` | Backs both search caching and cache invalidation.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `SEARCH_CACHE_TTL`                   | `app/config.py` → `search_cache_ttl` | `60` (seconds)         | ⚠️ `.env.example` currently defines this as `TASKS_CACHE_TTL`, which `Settings` does not read — the app silently falls back to the `60`s default regardless of that value. Rename it to `SEARCH_CACHE_TTL` in your `.env` if you need a different TTL. |
| `DATABASE_URL` / `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | `app/config.py`                      | — (required)           | Full SQLAlchemy connection strings; `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is used by the isolated test stack.                                                                                                                                                            |

## Engineering Decisions

**pgvector over a dedicated vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate)**

At this scale, PostgreSQL + pgvector eliminates the operational overhead of running a separate service. The HNSW
index delivers sub-millisecond search. A dedicated vector DB becomes worthwhile at 10M+ vectors or when
multi-tenancy grows complex.

**Local sentence-transformers over OpenAI embeddings**

Zero API cost, zero external dependency, fully reproducible results. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` produces 384-dimensional
embeddings — smaller and faster than OpenAI's 1536-dimensional `text-embedding-ada-002`, with comparable quality for
English retrieval.

**HNSW index over IVFFlat**

HNSW builds incrementally and works on an empty table. IVFFlat requires a `VACUUM ANALYZE` after bulk inserts to
build clusters. HNSW uses more memory but delivers better query-time performance and simpler operational behaviour.

**`BackgroundTasks` over Celery — for now**

`BackgroundTasks` runs in-process, in the same event loop, after the response is sent. For CPU-bound work like
`sentence-transformers` inference, that means the embedding call occupies the worker — other requests hitting that
same Gunicorn worker queue behind it until embedding finishes (mitigated today by `run_in_threadpool` inside
`embedding_service.py`, which moves the blocking call off the main event loop thread, but it's still bounded by
the same process's thread pool, not truly isolated). A real task queue (Celery/RQ + Redis or RabbitMQ) runs work
in separate processes, so a burst of slow embedding jobs can't starve API request handling at all, and jobs survive
a process restart. `BackgroundTasks` is the right call for getting unblocked today; Celery is the right call once
ingestion volume or embedding latency grows enough that a single failed deploy can't be allowed to drop in-flight
jobs.

**Why an explicit `status` column instead of inferring state from `chunk_count`**

`chunk_count == 0` is ambiguous: it's true both for a document that hasn't started processing yet *and* for one
that failed immediately (e.g., chunking threw before any chunk was created) *and*, by coincidence, for a real edge
case — an empty/degenerate document that legitimately produces zero chunks after `completed` processing. An
explicit `status` column removes the guesswork and the race condition where a client polling on `chunk_count > 0`
would report `completed` prematurely if it caught the document between chunk-row inserts (e.g. after 2 of 4 chunks
were committed, before the final `status="completed"` update lands).

**A fresh DB session for background tasks**

The `Depends(get_db)` session is scoped to the request lifecycle — by the time a `BackgroundTasks` callback runs,
the request has already returned a response and that generator-based session is on its way to being torn down.
Reusing it would mean operating on a session that may already be closed, mid-rollback, or being recycled by
SQLAlchemy's pool for an unrelated request. The background function opens its own session via `get_db()`/
`closing(...)`, independent of any request's lifecycle, and is responsible for its own `commit`/`rollback`.

### Out of scope (by request)

Hard Mode (Слой 7: `GET /api/documents/{id}/status` with `Retry-After`, and the idempotency check for
duplicate in-flight `POST`s) was intentionally left out of this pass.

### Follow-up iteration (beyond the original ticket)

Shipped after the initial async-processing ticket, in later commits:

- Content deduplication via SHA-256 `content_hash`, with per-document `chunking_time_ms` / `embedding_time_ms` /
  `total_processing_time_ms` metrics added in the same migration.
- Redis-backed search result caching with `X-Cache` headers and completion-triggered invalidation.
- Request-id tagging and per-request latency logging (`X-Request-ID`, `X-Response-Time`) via
  `ProfilerAndExceptionMiddleware`.
- Duplicate HNSW index removed (`ab8ab01e1746` had created it once; a later migration branch created a second
  one, cleaned up via `c1698571fb87` + a merge migration).

### Smaller things worth a look

- `process_document_background` opens its session via `closing(next(get_db()))`. This calls `.close()` on exit but
  never resumes the `get_db()` generator past its `yield`, so `get_db()`'s own `try/commit`/`except/rollback`
  logic never executes for this path — the function compensates by calling `db.commit()` / `db.rollback()` itself
  explicitly, which works correctly, but it's a slightly unusual use of the dependency generator. Left as-is since
  it's functionally correct; worth a comment if it trips someone up later.
